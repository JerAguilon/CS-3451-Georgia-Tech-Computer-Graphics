# CS-3451-Georgia-Tech-Computer-Graphics

A collection of graphics assignments, including object modeling, ray tracing, and GPU programming

I took this course in in Fall 2017. I am publicly listing this as a showcase of my work
in college. Relevant achievements include a ray tracing engine, GPU programming,
animation, object modeling, and fancy matrix projections.

Overall, CS 3451 was an interesting and challenging experience that bridges theory with applicability.
Definitely recommend it.
